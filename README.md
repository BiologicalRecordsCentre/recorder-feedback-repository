# Recorder Feedback Repository

Part of the Recorder Feedback system: https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/recorder-feedback

Welcome to the **Recorder Feedback Repository**! This site provides resources, templates, and ideas to help you design effective personalised feedback systems that improve engagement, data quality, and targeted data collection.

## About This Repository

Biological recorders and other contributors play a vital role in providing biodiversity and data insights. Personalised feedback can help:
- **Boost Engagement**: Encourage recorders to stay active and motivated.  
- **Improve Data Quality**: Offer constructive feedback to refine contributions.  
- **Target Data Collection**: Nudge recorders toward areas or species of greatest need.

## Projects

Here the ideas are grouped by project. Within each project page you will find a readme with project background (motivation, design process) and then any content derived from the project.

### TSDA (2025)

A large-scale experiment (500-1000 participants) to test the effectiveness of personalised feedback in influencing recorder behaviour.

### PoMS personalised feedback trial (2024)

A small scale demonstrator of recorder feedback to a semi-structured monitoring scheme (timed counts).

### MyDECIDE (2021)

A large scale experiement (850 participants) 

## Prototypes and ideas

Here we can capture content in early stages of development.

### Outputs from TEPoP workshop (November 2024)

The ouputs from a workshop "Designing personalised feedback to inspire biological recorders and fill data gaps" run as part of the TEPoP Autumn Festival
