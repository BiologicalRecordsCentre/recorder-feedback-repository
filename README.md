# Recorder Feedback Repository

Part of the Recorder Feedback system: https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/recorder-feedback

Welcome to the **Recorder Feedback Repository**! This site provides resources, templates, and ideas to help you design effective personalised feedback systems that improve engagement, data quality, and targeted data collection.

## About This Repository

Biological recorders and other contributors play a vital role in providing biodiversity and data insights. Personalised feedback can help:
- **Boost Engagement**: Encourage recorders to stay active and motivated.  
- **Improve Data Quality**: Offer constructive feedback to refine contributions.  
- **Target Data Collection**: Nudge recorders toward areas or species of greatest need.

## Projects

Here the ideas are grouped by project. Within each project page you will find a readme with project background (motivation, design process) and then any content derived from the project.

### TSDA (2025)

A large-scale experiment (500-1000 participants) to test the effectiveness of personalised feedback in influencing recorder behaviour.

### PoMS personalised feedback trial (2024)

A small scale demonstrator of recorder feedback to a semi-structured monitoring scheme (timed counts).

### [MyDECIDE (2022)](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/recorder-feedback-repository/tree/main/projects/MyDECIDE_2022)

MyDECIDE was a component of the broader DECIDE project, which aimed to improve biological recording by encouraging recorders to sample high-priority locations identified via species distribution models. The DECIDE Recorder Tool, a web application, guided users to areas in Great Britain where butterfly and moth recording would be most valuable. MyDECIDE complemented this by sending personalised or generalised data-driven emails (‘data stories’) to participants, tailored to their recording history and motivations, to enhance engagement and encourage use of the Tool. An experiement with ~850 participants.

## Prototypes and ideas

Here we can capture content in early stages of development.

### Outputs from TEPoP workshop (November 2024)

The ouputs from a workshop "Designing personalised feedback to inspire biological recorders and fill data gaps" run as part of the TEPoP Autumn Festival
