# Recorder Feedback Repository

Welcome to the **Recorder Feedback Repository**! This site provides resources, templates, and ideas to help you design effective personalised feedback systems that improve engagement, data quality, and targeted data collection. Whether you're working with biological recorders, managing data projects, or exploring feedback in other contexts, you'll find valuable tools here.

## About This Repository

Biological recorders and other contributors play a vital role in providing biodiversity and data insights. Personalised feedback can help:
- **Boost Engagement**: Encourage recorders to stay active and motivated.  
- **Improve Data Quality**: Offer constructive feedback to refine contributions.  
- **Target Data Collection**: Nudge recorders toward areas or species of greatest need.

## Projects

Here the ideas are grouped by project. Within each project page you will find a readme with project background (motivation, design process)

### TSDA (2025)

A large-scale experiment (500-1000 participants) to test the effectiveness of personalised feedback in influencing recorder behaviour.

### PoMS personalised feedback trial (2024)

A small scale demonstrator of recorder feedback to a semi-structured monitoring scheme (timed counts).

### MyDECIDE (2021)

A large scale experiement (850 participants) 

## Prototypes and ideas

### Outputs from TEPoP workshop (November 2024)

The ouputs from a workshop "Designing personalised feedback to inspire biological recorders and fill data gaps" run as part of the TEPoP Autumn Festival
