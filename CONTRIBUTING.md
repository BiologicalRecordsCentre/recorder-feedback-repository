## Contribution Guidelines  

### Adding a contribution about a perticular project or area of work

Create a new directory under `projects/` with the name of the project and add a `README.md` using the template provided in `projects/template.md`.

To complete the README.md for a project, start with the project name at the top as a clear and descriptive title that reflects the work. Under the Background section, describe the context of the project, including its origins, connection to broader programmes or initiatives, and the key stakeholders involved. Explain why the project matters, such as its role in advancing biodiversity monitoring or improving data collection.

In the External References section, include any links to resources that provide additional context or information. These could be websites, published papers, reports, or related repositories. Make the links easy to scan and directly relevant to the project.

For Motivation, describe the purpose of incorporating feedback into the project. Highlight the goals, such as increasing engagement, improving data quality, or directing efforts toward specific species or areas. If there were specific hypotheses or assumptions behind using feedback, note these as well.

In Ideation/Design Process, summarise how the feedback approach was developed. Mention initial research, co-design workshops, or prototyping steps that influenced the final design. If citizen scientists or other stakeholders were involved, note their contributions and how their input shaped the content.

Use the Challenges and Lessons Learnt section to reflect on difficulties faced during the project, such as technical hurdles, engagement issues, or limitations in feedback delivery. Explain how you addressed these challenges and what you might do differently in future.

The Tech Stack section should list the key technologies, tools, or programming languages used in the project, such as R, Python, or specific libraries.

Finally, in Included Content, detail what contributions are provided in the repository. Break this into subsections: Concepts (early designs or sketches), Prototypes (preliminary versions), Implementations (final outputs), and Code (scripts or templates). Include links to specific files or folders within the repository for easy access.
